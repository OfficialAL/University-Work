        <h3>Video Transcript</h3>
        <p>
So, you want a traditional tasting curry, but then there's the price of spices, and the price of the butter, and all the fats, and the milk. Just... what if I told you you could have a curry, say; a butter chicken for this price right here per serving, that is but cheaper. [Music]
<br>
<br>

So when you go to a restaurant, you're looking at getting a curry. It can end up being 10, 15, 20, 25 dollars. That's because all those spices, all those expensive sort of fats, whether it's coconut milk or heavy cream or lots of butter, we just need to condense it somehow, simplify it while maximizing its flavor.
<br>
<br>
So, with all that said, let's make this, shall we? Right, uh, cheap curry josh. Okay, resist the truffles, resist the fancy spices. Okay, start off with a medium-sized bowl, add one cup or 240 grams of full-fat yogurt. Then whisk in one tablespoon or 15 grams of garam masala and 1 tablespoon or 15 grams of kosher salt. Whisk that together until thoroughly combined. Then separately, get yourself one and a half pounds or 680 grams of boneless, skinless chicken thighs. Slice those into nice bite-sized pieces that are around one inch thick. As per usual, keep them even, keep papa happy. Simple concept.
<br>
<br>
Toss all your chicken into its creamy bath, then mix that together until thoroughly coated. Give it a little sound check, lovingly. Then just cover that with plastic wrap and let that marinate for at least 30 minutes, but ideally overnight. Granted, you could skip the marinade entirely, but it makes a flavor difference.<br>
<br>			
Okay, next up, get yourself a large deep pan like a brazer or a medium-sized pot. Heat two tablespoons or 30 grams of vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Once that's shimmering and hotter than my buttocks after sitting on a chair that doesn't really breathe very well, add your marinated chicken in batches to avoid overcrowding and sear for two to three minutes. Flip. Should be nice and golden brown, maybe even lightly charred. And sear the other side for another two minutes. We just want color as fast as possible. You don't want to cook the chicken all the way through yet.
<br>
<br>
Now, once all of your chicken is beautifully browned, make sure the pan is clear, then hit it with a touch more oil. Then lower your heat to medium and add one yellow onion that's been evenly diced, a two-inch knob of ginger that's been finely diced, or more specifically, brunoise for the culinary height beasts watching, and six cloves of sliced garlic. Season that to taste with kosher salt, fresh ground black pepper. Then cook and stir, making sure to scrape the bottom. And if you have an especially thick fond like I did, that's the brown good stuck stuff on the bottom, you can add a small splash of water to loosen that. Now, make sure to cook all that water off, then just saut√© your vegetables for about 3 minutes or until everything has been softened. 
<br>
<br>
Then add two teaspoons or eight grams of smoked or regular paprika, two teaspoons or nine grams of ground cumin, one tablespoon or 14 grams of garam masala, one and a half teaspoons or six grams of turmeric powder, which is completely optional. Then stir that together and let those spices toast for about one to two minutes or until intensely fragrant. Then add a 14-ounce can of good quality crushed tomatoes. Swirl around 2/3 of a cup or 160 milliliters of water in that can, then dump it back into your pan. Less wasteful and you need the water. Stir together until everything is incorporated. Leave that on medium heat until it begins to simmer. Then just let that simmer and reduce for five to eight minutes or until the sauce has been reduced about 30 and is thickened. Optionally, you can use a hand blender to get a little smoother, but believe it or not, I won't roast you if you don't use one.
<br>
<br>
Now, once that's nicely reduced, add your chicken back to the pan. Distribute throughout the sauce and let it simmer another three to five minutes or until the chicken is cooked through and hot. And look, you can totally use a lid to speed up that process. Now last but not least, my favorite part, pour in one cup or 240 milliliters of heavy cream. Look at the creamy streamy. Then just stir all that together. Bring it up to a light simmer, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for no more than about three to four minutes, stirring often. Then, last but not least, turn off the heat and stir in 2 tablespoons or 28 grams of unsalted butter. Important note: continuously stir as that's melting so that it emulsifies properly into the sauce.
<br>
<br>
Now give it a little taste, adjust salt levels if needed. And just look at this curry. Just one look at this curry and you're gonna be saying, "Lord, I have mercy, I'm about to bust." Now, all you gotta do is get a nice shallow bowl, hit it with your desired amount of beautifully steamed rice, a generous portion of your curry, some additional sauce for good measure, and of course, some fresh cilantro leaves. All for this price per serving. Rat gosh darn hair. Now, let's taste test to see if its flavor is as luxurious as it looks.
<br>
<br>
Wow, wow. And for this price right here, what? That's so good. Beautiful curry. It's thick, juicy, luscious, silky. I caught it. It's been blessed. Wow, this really actually doesn't taste any different than any of the other curries that I've made, which are all amazing for the record, but I pulled back on this more extravagant spices that I would normally use. But really, we ended up with a curry that is honestly just as flavorful and emphasizes the more simplistic aspect while saving money. Do you want to save money or not and have it be really yummy? That heads, I've made the chicken tikka masala a million times over. This just seems like an easier way to do it and it's just as good. So, if you like that, I think you'll like this. Okay, you're well. This isn't about better. We still won. We still won the fight for yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy. Yeah, but cheaper, this price for a curry. Please enjoy. You want to know what else is creamy, hot, and made for your mouth? B-roll. [Music]
<br>
<br>
Okay, so we made our but cheaper curry for this price right here per serving. That's per serving, folks. All right, a lot of people get mad about it. Oh, look at that. I have to go buy this. Shut up. I really think it has all those classic flavors that you expect in a curry but obviously it's not as expensive and it's easy. You can put this thing together in like 15 minutes, not excluding the marinating time. But like, are you really gonna count me for that? Fine, skip the marinating and it takes 15 minutes anyway. The point is that is a proper butt cheaper of a curry. And if you enjoyed this video or you learned something, leave a like, subscribe, and I will see you next time. Papa very confused and tired. Papa take a nap. Okay, good night. [Music]
